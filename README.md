**final version will include:**

A platform to search for dance classes, read reviews and discover social dance events. 

The application displays dance schools in a specific area, where users can search for dance classes based on a specific dance style (e.g. salsa, tango or rock). In the application it's possible to check the schedules for these events and read their reviews. Each user is either a basic user or an administrator.

* The user can log in and out, as well as create a new account.
* The user sees dance schools as a list and can select a school to view more information (such as dance styles and reviews).
* The user can provide a review (stars and comments) for a school and read reviews from others.
* The administrator can add and remove schools and specify the information displayed about the school.
* The user can search for all schools whose description contains a given word (e.g. dance style "Tango").
* The user also sees a list where schools are ranked from best to worst according to reviews.
* The administrator can, if necessary, delete a review provided by a user.
* The administrator can create groups to classify schools. A school can belong to one or more groups. Groups can be e.g. "Latin", "Ballroom" or "Hip-Hop".
